# Advent of Code, 2022

## Day 1

I took a bit of a brute force approach, not super pythonic.
As I read in the input, I kept a running sum of the calories for that elf.
Once done with that elf, compared to max value(s).
At least I didn't write my own sort algorithm.

Others in the RealPython slack channel did more with map and sum.
I like their solutions but mine scales to crazy large input, and I find it more readable.

## Day 2

I thought I'd take a more pythonic approach on day 2.
I decided it was quickest to configure some static maps for various points and game play results,
then again keep a running calculation as I read in the input.

## day 3
